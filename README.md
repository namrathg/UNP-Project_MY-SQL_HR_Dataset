II. SQL Project
Completed this project as part of my My SQL Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP)

Key Highlights:

1) Database Design: The project includes a well-structured database design with three tables (EmpPerformance, EmpDepartments, and EmpDetails) to store employee performance, department, and employee details data, respectively.
2) Backup Database: A backup database named Human_Resources_Backup is created to ensure data safety and provide a restore point for the main database.
3) Data Cleaning and Conversion: The PerformanceRating column in the EmpPerformance table is updated with integer values corresponding to the performance ratings, ensuring consistent data representation.
4) Data Transfer: The contents of the tables in the backup database are copied to the main Human_Resources database, ensuring data consistency between the two databases.
5) Informative SQL Queries: A set of SQL queries is provided to analyze the data in the Human_Resources database, covering aspects such as employee distribution, salary analysis, department performance, and recruitment source analysis. These queries can help the organization make informed decisions based on the data.
